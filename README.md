# CODSOFT
As part of my internship on Artificial Intelligence at CodSoft the first task is to build a "CHATBOT WITH RULE_BASED RESPONSES" and the instructions for it are:
"Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow."
The "CodSoft_ChatBot.py" is the implementation of how i achieved.
